// This file is the zero-copy weight path's resolver. A checkpoint is memory-mapped once
// (safetensors.LoadDirMmap → *DirMapping), each shard's page-aligned mmap is wrapped in ONE
// Metal no-copy buffer (bytesNoCopy — proven GPU-readable by TestNoCopyMmapGPURead), and every
// weight tensor (which VIEWS its shard's mmap) is addressed by its byte offset INTO that shard's
// buffer rather than uploaded into a fresh owned buffer. So a multi-GB checkpoint is never
// duplicated in heap or GPU memory, and the per-token LM-head re-upload balloon is gone (the
// head binds the persistent shard buffer at the embedding's offset, every token, with no upload).

// bufView is a weight bound zero-copy: a shard's no-copy Metal buffer plus the weight's byte
// offset into it. It replaces a per-weight owned (copied) buffer everywhere the decode binds
// weights — the projectors, the layer norms, the head/embed. off is fed to the enc ops'
// input-offset params (mirrors the output-offset the cache-write path already uses).
