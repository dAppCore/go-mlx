// arch_spec.go is the REACTIVE architecture contract: a model package declares itself once — its config
// parser and (with model.Assemble) its weight-name conventions — and the engine's loader REACTS to that
// declaration. Adding an architecture becomes a config + a registration, not a re-implementation of the
// load path. It supersedes the dispatch-only model_type loader registry
// to react across the WHOLE load:
//
//	read config.json → probe model_type → LookupArch → spec.Parse → cfg.InferFromWeights →
//	cfg.Arch() → model.Assemble(tensors, arch, spec.Weights)
//
// model.Load (engine move 3) is that orchestration, and it lives here in the backend-agnostic root —
// so every backend (native, go-rocm) inherits ONE reactive loader rather than re-rolling it.

// ArchConfig is one architecture's parsed, validated config as the loader drives it: it resolves any
// dimension the config omits from the weight SHAPES (the don't-guess rule — see InferHeadDim), then
// derives the neutral decode Arch. InferFromWeights is a no-op for an architecture that declares every
// dimension; the dim-from-shape SELECTION (which weight, which attention-typed layer) is
// genuine per-arch logic, so it is a method here rather than declared data.
